== Praktische Aufgabenstellung: Jan Binder

== Back End: Datenbank und Datenbankverbindung

=== Begin

Zu aller erst wurden die allgemeinen Grundlagen, wie die Technologie, die verwendet wird, und das Design festgelegt. Auch die Datenbank, in der die entsprechenden Tabellen und Datensätze stehen soll, wurde vereinbart.

First of all the basics, like the technology we are using and the design are set. The database, in which all the tables and data sets are, is also appointed.

=== Grundlagen

Man braucht, um eine Datenbank und eine Datenbankverbindung zu erzeugen, ein gewisses Vorwissen. Hier werden SQL, JPA und Java von Nöten sein. Also wie das Programm mit der Datenbank kommuniziert und wie sogenannte Queries erstellt werden.

You need some foreknowledgement to build a database and a database connectivity. Knowlegde about SQL, JPA and Java is required. You need these languages to create queriesor to understand how the program communicates with the database.

==== SQL

SQL is short for "Structured Query Language". It is used to insert, change and delete data sets or create or delete tables.

.Beispielcode von SQL
[source, SQL]
----
<1>
CREATE TABLE mitarbeiter ( 
    id integer,
    nachname text,
    vorname text,
    gehalt integer
);

<2>
INSERT INTO mitarbeiter (id, nachname, vorname, gehalt)
VALUES (1, Mustermann, Max, 2000);


<3>
SELECT * FROM mitarbeiter;

<4>
ALTER TABLE mitarbeiter ADD CONSTRAINT "MITARBEITER_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id");
----
<1> All this code does is it creates a new table called "mitarbeiter" which contains the columns "id", "nachname", "vorname" and "gehalt". Every column has its datatype next to it. Optionally there are constraints to the columns, such as "NOT NULL". which tells the database that this column cannot be empty or "UNIQUE", which means that a data set must be unique in this column.

<2> The next command is INSERT INTO. This code tells the database to write data into the table. First you need to set the table with all its columns and then the values like shown.

<3> The "SELECT * FROM mitarbeiter;" command picks out every data set from the table "mitarbeiter". This is done by the '*' parameter. Further there is a possibility to only select a few specific data sets.

<4> This command lets you change an already existing table. In this example I updated the tables constraints, in detail I set the primary key of the table.


==== JPA





=== Getting Started




==== ER-Modell

image::../diagrams/diagram-classes.png[]

The ER-Model in general is a diagram, which shows the relationships between the entities of a database.

In this chapter I will showcase all the tables with their attributes and their respective meanings. Starting from the bottom to the top.

===== Trainee

The first table is the table "Trainee". This table contains all trainees. It contains their first name, last name, the nickname they use on the website, their department in the company and their progress they have by doing quizzes. Also every Trainee can get emblemes by completing quizzes.
It has a One-To-Many relationship to the table "Quizbeantwortung" and to the table "KursBesuch".

===== KursBesuch

The entity "KursBesuch" is a table, which splits the many-to-many relationship between "trainee" and "kurs" into two seperate One-To-Many relationships therefor its relationships are Many-To-One to "Trainee" and to "Kurs".
That means it has the PK (primary key) of both tables as a foreign key. It also provides a column named "datum" which indicates the date the user has visited the course. The function of this entity is to show which trainee has done which course and when. 

===== KursVoraussetzung

The function of "KursVoraussetzung" is that a course can have a course or a quiz as a requirement to take this course. This table contains courses and their required quizzes or courses. Therefor it contains the "KursVoraussetzID", the "KursID" and the "VoraussetzID" as columns.


===== QuizVoraussetzung

This table has the same function as "KursVoraussetzung", but instead of courses with quizzes. So this table contains quizzes and the requirements to take this quiz, which can be courses or  previous quizzes.


===== Quizbeantwortung

This entity is essential for the implementation of the "Voraussetzungs-Logik". We need this table to check if a trainee has already done a quiz. This is done with the column "istbestanden". Also it stores the points a trainee has achieved in the quiz. It also splits up a Many-To-Many relationship between "Quiz" and "Trainee" into two One-To-Many relationships.

===== Kurs

Here is the Kurs-Entity, it has the primary key "KursID", which helps to find a specific course from the table. 
The table also has a column "titel" which is basically the title of this course. 
It also has the constraint NOT NULL so if there is a new course there must be a title as well.
The next column is the "link" it contains the links of the courses so the visitors can be redirected to the page with the explanation of the topic.
This cannot be empty too. 
The last column is "beschreibung", which is the description of the course. 
This column can be empty, but it is not recommended since it helps the user specify which course contains what information.

==== EJBs

EJBs are components that summarize the business logic and take care of transactions and security. It is basically a connection to the database. 

.KursEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/kurs/KursEJB.java[lines=16..]
----

The main use of the EJB is to provide the courses page with all the courses within the database. This is done with the "findAll" methode.

.FrageEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/quiz/FrageEJB.java[lines=21..]
----

The use of the "FrageEJB" is for example to find all questions connected to a qid. This is used to show the questions when you take a quiz. Also it is available to only find one question or all questions in form of a list.

.QuizEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/quiz/QuizEJB.java[lines=16..]
----

The function of this EJB is to find all quizzes from the database and return them in a list to the website. Also you can find single quizzes with the methode "find", you can delete and update quizzes.

.TraineeEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/trainee/TraineeEJB.java[lines=16..]
----

The use of this class is to provide all the trainees deposited on the database to the associated web page. As in every other EJB there is an opportunity to find, update or delete a trainee.

.AntwortmoeglichkeitenEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/quiz/AntwortmoeglichkeitenEJB.java[lines=16..]
----

This EJB provides the page where you take the quiz with all the corresponding answers to the questions. This is done by the methode "findAntwortenByFID" which starts a query when invoked. This query is defined in the "Antwortmoeglichkeiten" entity.

.QuizVoraussetzungEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/quiz/QuizVoraussetzungEJB.java[lines=13..]
----

The "QuizVoraussetzungsEJB" allocates all "QuizVoraussetzungen" with the "findAllQuizVoraussetzungen" methode. It is used in the "Voraussetzungs-Logic".

.VoraussetzungEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/kurs/VoraussetzungEJB.java[lines=16..]
----

This EJB is used for the requirements logic. It contains a find methode where you can search for a requirement via a "VoraussetzID", which then returns a "Voraussetzung"-Entity. Also it has a update and delete methode.

.QuizbeantwortungEJB.java
[source, java]
----
include::../../game-trainee-web/src/main/java/org/game/trainee/quiz/QuizbeantwortungEJB.java[lines=13..]
----

The use of this bean is to provide information to all the quizzes a specific trainee has taken and when. This is done by a query, which is defined in the entity of this bean and it is required in the requirement logic.

==== Persistence.xml

.persistence.xml

The "persistence.xml" is used to configure many things, such as the source of the scipt used for dropping, if the database should always drop and then create all tables, and much more.



==== SQL-Files

In this chapter I will introduce all SQL-files used in this project in the order they are runned when the program is started.


.dropSQL.sql

This script has the function of dropping every table before creating so there are no errors. 


.createSQL.sql

This file is used to create all the tables we are using. It produces every table with its associated columns.
This file is also used to give all the tables its associated primary keys and foreign keys.


.insertSQL.sql

Last there is the "insertSQL" script, which is used to insert all the data we want into the belonging table. The order of the commands is very important because, if you insert "antwortmoeglichkeiten" at first there would be no existing matching "FNR" or with "frage " no fitting "QID". Here are only the first insert of every table because otherwise there would be too much code, which would make it too complex.
