== Knowledge management
=== Knowledge

Knowledge is omnipresent whereever we go. Everyone around has more or less knowledge about every kind of topic.

The definition of knowledge is a problem since the early ages. Philosophers like Aristoteles or Platon, who lived ~400 years before christ, worried about what knowledge really is. It is connected to the search of truth. The approach of Platon says that knowledge is acquired by means of deduction, the absolut truth develops through thinking logically. Aristoteles opinion is, that the sensory perception is the only source of insight. The next assumption to this topic wanted to include both approaches and said it is a combination of both. Till now there is only an agreement of the fact, that knowledge is not static and not the absolut truth.
