=== Technical Context

The abstract technical context is described by the following C4-model:

The GAME system is precisely described through this C4-model:

=== Description

The game system communicates with the following systems:

* skill management system
** This system transmits the current progress of the employees to the GAME System and vice versa.

* training system "SkillA"
** This system transfers existing progress of trainees to the GAME system.

* SAP employee management system
** This system transmits the current progress of the employees to the GAME System and vice versa.

=== Considerations

In the point system several difficulty levels are defined which reward the user with previously determined points.

The trainer has to give every module he created a certain difficulty level.

In the beginning it should be possible to manually enter the progresses of trainees from "SkillA" in the progress system.
