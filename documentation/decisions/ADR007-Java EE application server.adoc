=== ADR007-Java EE application server

==== Status

accpeted

==== Context

Applications which are implemented on top of the Java EE specification, which is defined as the base technology of the GAME application in the link:ADR002-Technology stack.adoc[ADR002-Technology stack], need an application server as runtime environment.

==== Decision

The link:https://wildfly.org/[Wildfly application server] will be used as the default application server in the GAME application.

The Wildfly application is open source and has full support for the Java EE 8 specification. It is also widely used in the ARZ and therefore the medium of choice.

==== Consequences

Wildfly is defined as the default application server of the application, but the application must be as Java EE standard compliant as possible, so that the portability of the application is still warranted.
Further it must be possible to run the application also on application servers which are just Java EE Web Proile compliant.
