=== ADR007-Java EE application server

==== Status

accepted

==== Context

Applications which are implemented on top of the Java EE specification, which is defined as the base technology of the GAME application in the chapter "ADR002-Technology stack", need an application server as runtime environment.

==== Decision

The link:https://wildfly.org/[Wildfly application server] will be used as the default application server in the GAME application.

The Wildfly application is open source and has full support for the Java EE 8 specification. It is also widely used in the ARZ and therefore the medium of choice.

==== Consequences

Wildfly is defined as the default application server of the application, but the system must be as Java EE standard compliant as possible, so that the portability of the application is still warranted.
Furthermore, it must be possible to run the application on application servers which are just Java EE Web Proile compliant.
