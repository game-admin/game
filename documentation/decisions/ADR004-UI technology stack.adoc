= ADR004-UI technology stack

== Status
accpeted

== Context

The primary user interface of the GAME application will be web based. Therefore a web UI Toolkit is needed for an efficient development of the UI an seamless integration with the backend systems.

== Decision

As described in link:./ADR002-Technology stack.adoc[ADR002-Technology stack] Java EE is the base technology stack for the GAME application. The Java EE standard defines the JSF substandard as its UI Framework/Toolkit for web based applications. Therefore the web based UI of the GAME application will be developed with the JSF framework.

== Consequences

For some parts of a modern web based UI, the JSF framework doesn't have components to develop the UI efficient. For these parts it is allowed to use components of the link:https://www.primefaces.org/[Primefaces] UI library.
