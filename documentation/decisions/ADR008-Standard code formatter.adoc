= ADR008-Standard code formatter

== Status

accpeted

== Context

For seamless working together on a shared code base it is advantageous to use the same code formatter. So a standard code formatter must be defined.

== Decision

The standard code format is defined in the file link:formatter.xml[]. This XML is created as an link:https://www.eclipse.org/[eclipse]-Formatter file, but can also be importet in other IDEs, such as Apache Netbeans or IntelliJ Idea.

== Consequences

Everyone who creates or changes source code for the GAME application in this repository, must use this formatter setup to format the source code.
