=== ADR003-Build and dependency managament

==== Status

accepted

==== Context

The GAME application consists of different subsystems. To make it possible that these subsystems can be automatically built and bundled, a build and dependency management tool ist needed.

==== Decision

link:https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven] will be used for build and dependency management. This tool is well-proven and can be extended with many plugins. Its convention-over-configuration paradigma lets a developer focus on creating the software.
