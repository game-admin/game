=== ADR001-BuildingFromScratch

==== Status
accepted

==== Context
The ARZ wants to create a learning platform for their members. The project team evaluated possibly alternatives to adapt from. An alternative needs to be able to run on-premise, be up to date with todays standards and preferably be opensource. The evaluated systems are the following:

http://www.javaranch.com

 * is based on "JForum" (a java forum)
 * OpenSource
 * Code is on SourceForge
 
 -> doesn't meet the expectations

http://www.skill-guru.com

 * no On-premise possible

 -> therefore  excluded

http://www.betterprogrammer.com

 * no further development, outdated (java version 1.5/1.6)

 -> therefore not effective

http://www.javapassion.com

 * no possibility for extensions

 * developed by an individual person
 
 -> therefore no viable option


==== Decision
None of the evaluated systems meet the requirements, so the system will be build up from scratch by the project team.


==== Consequences

Development of a web application based on Java/Java Enterprise.
