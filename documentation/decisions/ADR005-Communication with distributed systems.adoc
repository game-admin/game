=== ADR005-Communication with distributed systems

==== Status

accpeted

==== Context

The GAME application must be able to communicate with other distributed systems in both directions (inbound and outbound).

==== Decision

The GAME application will provide resources for other distributed systems via link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer[RESTful webservices].

By using a stateless protocol (link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol[HTTP]) and standard operations, RESTful systems aim for fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow by reusing components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running. 
It is also evolving as the defacto standard for communication between distributed systems in the digital age.

==== Consequences

JAX-RS is the standard for creating RESTful Webservices in Java EE based applications and so it will be used in the GAME application.
